### Introduction

Hey there! Welcome to my little corner of the internet where I get to share my project, **Opposite**, with you. This 2D puzzle-platformer was born out when I finally decided to participate in my first Game Jam 1-BIT JAM, where the only rule was to use two colors, this game challenges your perception and coordination in ways you won't believe. Let’s dive into the journey of bringing **Opposite** to life!

### Project Overview

**What’s the Big Idea?**

The goal of **Opposite** was simple: create a game that’s as fun as it is challenging, all while sticking to a monochromatic theme. Picture this: you control two characters at the same time, each moving in opposite directions in a black-and-white world. Your mission? Get both characters into the square winning area without touching any spikes.

**My Role?**

Everything! From the first sketch to the final code, I wore all the hats. Conceptualization, design, coding – you name it, I did it.

**Game Jam:**

This project was submitted to the 1-BIT JAM. The challenge? Create a game using only two colors. Talk about a creative constraint!

### Development Process

**From Idea to Prototype:**

It all started with a lightbulb moment: what if you controlled two characters with opposite movements in a black-and-white world? I quickly sketched out the concept and jumped into developing a prototype.

Initial Design

**Design and Development:**

I designed 5 levels, each introducing new elements to ramp up the challenge. The development phase involved coding to handle the mirrored controls, spike hazards, portals, and the unique winning condition.

### Level Breakdown

**Level 1: Learning the Ropes**

The first level eases players into the controls and the concept of mirrored movements, with helpful blinking hints to guide them.

**Level 2: Spikes**

Here’s where the challenge ramps up. Players learn about spikes and the consequences of touching them.

**Level 3: Portals**

This level introduces portals that characters can pass through, adding a new layer of complexity and strategy.

**Levels 4-5: The Real Challenge**

The final levels combine platforms, spikes, portals, and the winning area to test the player’s skills and provide a thrilling experience.
