Hey there! Welcome to **GoWhere**, my personal project inspired by the **WeGoWhere** app. 🎉

GoWhere is a mobile app built using **React Native**, **Expo Router**, and **MongoDB**. It’s all about discovering, creating, and managing local events while connecting with people in fun, meaningful ways! Whether you're hosting a meetup, going to a concert, or just looking for new activities, GoWhere makes it super easy to express interest, chat with others, follow your favorite users, and search for events — all in one place.

**This app is still a work in progress, but I’m really excited about where it’s going! 💪**

## **Motivation 💡**

As a **long-time user of [WeGoWhere](https://apps.apple.com/th/app/wegowhere-%E0%B9%81%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%9E%E0%B8%AB%E0%B8%B2%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%9E-%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%99/id1458579256?l=th)**, I’ve always appreciated how it connects people to local events, but I often found myself wishing for a few extra features to make the experience more personalized. That’s what inspired me to create **GoWhere** — not as a commercial product, but as a personal learning project to improve my skills in **React Native**, **MongoDB.**

This project has taught me valuable lessons in full-stack development, user-centered design, and how to create intuitive, impactful features. While GoWhere started as a fun experiment for learning, it’s also helped me better understand the kinds of features that would take WeGoWhere to the next level. If I had the chance to join the WeGoWhere team, I’d bring that same passion for creating better experiences and improving apps from the user’s perspective. 🤝
