# Book Recommender System using ML
This is a collaborative filtering-based book recommender system built using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and deployed as a Streamlit web application. The app suggests books based on user interests by analyzing similarities between books.

## Live Demo
Deployed at streamlit : https://book-recommender-vishal.streamlit.app/

## Technologies Used
- KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors) for collaborative filtering.
- Streamlit for creating the web interface.
- Pandas for data handling.
- Scikit-learn for implementing KNN algorithm.
