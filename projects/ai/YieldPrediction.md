# Yield Prediction
This project aims to analyze agricultural data and build predictive models for yield prediction.

## Demo
Live: https://yield-prediction-ml.streamlit.app/

## Dataset
Dataset used : [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/patelris/crop-yield-prediction-dataset?select=yield_df.csv)
The dataset consists of various features related to agricultural production, including:
 - Area: Geographical region of the data (e.g., country, state).
 - Item: Type of crop.
 - Year: Year of data collection.
 - hg/ha_yield: Crop yield in hectograms per hectare.
 - average_rain_fall_mm_per_year: Average rainfall in millimeters.
 - pesticides_tonnes: Total amount of pesticides used.
 - avg_temp: Average temperature in degrees Celsius.
